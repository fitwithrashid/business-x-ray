# Opportunity Categories

**Fix options for each type of issue identified during process expansion.**

When presenting opportunities, provide category + options. User picks approach. Deep implementation = hire Rashid.

---

## How to Use

1. Identify the issue during annotation review pass
2. Match to category below
3. Present 2-4 options from the options list
4. User selects approach
5. Add to roadmap with selected approach

---

## Category 1: Bottleneck (Red)

**Definition:** A step that slows down the entire process. Often manual, time-consuming, or creates a queue.

**Signals:**
- "This takes forever"
- "I'm always behind on this"
- "Things pile up here"
- "I'm the only one who can do this"

**Options:**

| Option | Description | Best When |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Simplify** | Reduce steps, remove unnecessary work | Process is overcomplicated |
| **Systematize** | Create SOP, checklist, template | No standard process exists |
| **Batch** | Group similar tasks together | Context-switching is the problem |
| **Delegate** | Hand off to VA or team member | Owner shouldn't be doing this |
| **Automate** | Use AI or tool to handle | Repetitive, rule-based work |
| **Eliminate** | Remove the step entirely | Not actually necessary |

**Presentation Format:**

> **Bottleneck:** [Step Name]
> Takes [X hours/week] - slowing everything down
>
> Options:
> - **Simplify:** [Specific simplification]
> - **Delegate:** [Who could do this]
> - **Automate:** [Tool/AI that could help]
>
> Which approach fits your situation?

## Category 2: Automate (Orange)

**Definition:** A step that could be handled by AI, automation, or tools instead of manual human effort.

**Signals:**
- "I do this the same way every time"
- "It's just data entry"
- "I copy-paste a lot"
- "It's tedious but necessary"

**Options:**

| Option | Description | Best When |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **AI Agent** | Claude, ChatGPT, or custom AI | Writing, analysis, research tasks |
| **Zapier/Make** | Connect tools with automation | Moving data between platforms |
| **Native Integration** | Built-in tool connections | Tools already support it |
| **Template** | Pre-built starting point | Same structure, different content |

> - **Standard:** [Full version most businesses use]
> - **Advanced:** [Sophisticated version with automation]
>
> Which level makes sense for you right now?

## Category 4: Delegate (Purple/Orange)

**Definition:** A step that a human should do, but not the owner. Could be VA, team member, or contractor.

**Signals:**
- "I shouldn't be doing this"
- "Anyone could do this"
- "It's not strategic"
- "It's taking time from higher-value work"

**Options:**

| Option | Description | Best When |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **VA (General)** | Virtual assistant for admin tasks | General administrative work |
| **VA (Specialized)** | VA with specific skills | Technical tasks (design, video) |
| **Contractor** | Project-based specialist | One-time or occasional needs |
| **Team Member** | Full/part-time hire | Consistent, high-volume need |
| **Agency** | Outsource entire function | Want done-for-you service |

**Delegation Checklist:**

Before delegating, ensure you have:
- [ ] Clear process documented (SOP)
- [ ] Examples of good output
- [ ] Defined success metrics
- [ ] Communication channel
- [ ] Review/approval workflow

**Presentation Format:**

> **Delegate:** [Step Name]
> Owner shouldn't be doing this - [X hours/week] wasted
>
> Options:
> - **VA:** [What a VA could handle]
> - **Contractor:** [One-time project approach]
> - **Team:** [If volume justifies]
>
> Who makes sense for your stage?

## Category 5: Protect (Green)

**Definition:** High-value work that the owner SHOULD keep doing. Strategic, relationship-based, or creative.

- "Only I can do this well"
- "This is my zone of genius"

**Options:**

| Option | Description | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Protect time** | Block calendar for this work | Ensure it doesn't get squeezed |
| **Optimize setup** | Remove friction before/after | Minimize switching costs |
| **Batch similar** | Group related high-value work | Stay in flow state |
| **Remove interruptions** | Delegate what interrupts this | Maximize focus |

**Presentation Format:**

> **Protect:** [Step Name]
> This is high-value work - keep doing it!
>
> But we can help by:
> - **Protecting time:** Block [X] hours/week for this
> - **Removing friction:** [What to automate around it]
> - **Batching:** [How to group similar work]
>
> What's currently cutting into this time?

## Category 6: Eliminate (No Color)

**Definition:** Something that doesn't need to exist at all. Legacy process, unnecessary step, or busywork.

**Signals:**
- "We've always done it this way"
- "I don't know why we do this"
- "No one looks at this output"
- "It's probably not necessary"

**Questions to Ask:**

1. What happens if we stop doing this?
2. Who would notice?
3. When was the last time this mattered?
4. Is this for compliance/legal, or just habit?

**Presentation Format:**

> **Eliminate?:** [Step Name]
> This might not be necessary
>
> Test: What would break if you stopped?
> If nothing: Consider removing entirely
> If something: Simplify to minimum viable version

## Priority Scoring Guide

When multiple opportunities are identified, score each:

| Factor | Question | Score |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Impact** | How much will this improve the business? | 1 (Low) - 3 (High) |
| **Effort** | How hard to implement? | 1 (Hard) - 3 (Easy) |
| **Dependency** | Does other stuff depend on this? | 1 (No) - 3 (Yes, blocks others) |

**Total Score = Impact + Effort + Dependency**

| Score | Priority | Timeline |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 7-9 | Critical | Month 1, Week 1-2 |
| 5-6 | Important | Month 1-2 |
| 3-4 | Nice-to-have | Month 3 |
| 1-2 | Later | After 90 days |

## Presentation Template

After annotating a swimlane, present opportunities like this:

```
OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED:

1. **Bottleneck** [Step Name]
   Takes [X hours/week] - slowing things down
   - Option A: [Approach]
   - Option B: [Approach]
   - Option C: [Approach]
   → Which fits your situation?

2. **Automate** [Step Name]
   Currently manual, could be AI/tool
   - Option A: [Tool/AI solution]
   - Option B: [Tool/AI solution]
   → Which would help most?

3. **Digital Asset** [Missing Asset]
   Needed for [purpose]
   - Quick version: [Simple approach]
   - Full version: [Standard approach]
   → What level makes sense now?

---
Priority suggestion: Start with #1 (highest impact + easiest)
Want to adjust this order?
```

## Deep Implementation Note

> **For implementation beyond category selection:**
> These options are starting points. Deep implementation - building the actual SOPs, setting up automations, configuring tools, hiring/training VAs - is available through Rashid's services.
>
> The X-Ray identifies WHAT needs to happen. Implementation services make it happen.
